# LeetCode Solutions in Python

This repository contains my LeetCode practice solutions, written in Python.  
Solutions are organized by difficulty level:

- **easy/** : Easy problems  
- **medium/** : Medium problems  
- **hard/** : Hard problems  

Each problem is stored in its own folder or file, depending on how I worked on it at the time:

- Some problems have their own folder with:
  - `original.py` — my first working attempt  
  - `optim.py` *(or sometimes `template.py`)* — an optimized version or refined template  
- Others appear as a **single file**, which usually means:
  - It was my **first accepted solution** that worked; or  
  - It was already **optimal**, so I didn’t need a second version  

If I later revisit and find a more optimal approach,  
I’ll **convert** that single file into a **folder**, keeping my original solution  
alongside the improved version (`optim.py` or `template.py`).

> ⚠️ Note: The progress below reflects problems **that have been committed** to this repository.  
> I have solved more locally, which will be pushed after code review and annotation updates.

## 🧭 Learning Notes

Starting from the **Medium** problems, each solution includes detailed  
docstrings explaining my **thought process**, **key ideas**, and **complexity analysis**.  

Earlier **Easy** problems are being gradually updated with similar annotations  
as I revisit and review them.

### 💡 About

This repository reflects my **learning journey**, not just final polished code.  
Some solutions are direct optimal implementations,  
while others capture my **first working ideas** and evolving reasoning process.  

My goal is **continuous improvement** and documenting my progress over time.
