# LeetCode Solutions in Python

This repository contains my LeetCode practice solutions, written in Python.  
Solutions are organized by difficulty level:

- **easy/** : Easy problems  
- **medium/** : Medium problems  
- **hard/** : Hard problems  

Each problem is stored in its own folder or file, depending on how I worked on it at the time:
- Some problems have their own folder with:
  - `original.py` : my first working attempt  
  - `optim.py` : an optimized version or alternative approach  
- Other problems appear as a single file â€” in these cases I usually pushed the version that passed and was good enough at the time. (Some may already be optimal, some may be early working solutions.)

### Notes
This repo mainly reflects my learning process rather than a polished solution set.  
Some solutions are direct optimal implementations, while others are my first working ideas.  
My goal is continuous improvement and documenting my progress over time.
